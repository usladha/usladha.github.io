## __Structured Products__
We offer a range of structured products from third party issuers that do not use the traditional buy and hold approaches. Structured Products use derivates and trading strategies to give customised payouts. Certain structured products also offer the benefits of capital protection.

## __Real Estate Funds__
With market trends such as a shift towards nuclear families, double income families with higher disposable incomes, easy availability of home finance and tax incentives, the opportunities in the Real Estate sector are becoming more attractive.
Unlike direct purchases of property, the real estate funds have the ability to participate in the entire life cycle of real estate projects. They also give you the benefit of diversification across cities and projects without the burden of protecting and maintaining assets.
